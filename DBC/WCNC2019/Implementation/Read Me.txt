This is the "Read Me!" guide for the implementation of the research algorithm of the paper
"Degree-based Balanced Clustering for Large-Scale Software Defined Networks". The authors
of the paper are Talha Ibn Aziz, Shadman Protik, Md Sakhawat Hossen, Salimur Choudhury, and
Muhammad Mahbub Alam.

All the codes are implemented in C++ using the IDE Codeblocks and the graphs are generated
using OriginPro.

The folder "Codes" contains the source code files of our proposed algorithm Degree-based
Balanced Clustering (DBC). The contents of the folder (The important files are explained
below the file names) is as follows:

Codes->Input
	=>Contains text files containing the input network.
	=>First line of input is the number of switches and links
	=>The next lines of input are the connection details of each link
	=>First two numbers indicate switches, third number indicates link weight
	=>Files 11.txt to 18.txt each contain one random network
	=>Files 1.txt to 7.txt each contain 10 random networks
	=>The rest are for testing purposes
     ->Output (folder)
	=>Contains various results accumulated during the text phase of the algorithms.
	=>Most results are of a previous version of the algorithm.
     ->Results (folder)
	=>Contains the final result of the experiments, most following a fixed format
	=>The first number in the format is the number of switches, the second number is
		the number of controllers, and the third number is the result value
	=>The result value can be different depending on the type of experiment, which
		can be understood from the text file name.
     ->alpha_check.cpp
	=>This code is for finding the latency values for different alpha values.
     ->data_generate.cpp
     ->dbcp.cpp
	=>This code is the implementation of the algorithm Density Based Controller
		Placement (DBCP)
     ->format.cpp
     ->improvement_vs_k_u70.cpp
     ->Input_metadata.cpp
     ->isbc.cpp
     ->k_vs_omega.cpp
     ->mbpc_test.cpp
     ->new_cpp.cpp
     ->new_dbc.cpp
	=>This code is the final version of DBC
     ->new_idbc.cpp
     ->pgca.cpp
     ->test.cpp
     ->DBC.opj
	=>This is the origin pro file for plotting the graphs of DBC.
