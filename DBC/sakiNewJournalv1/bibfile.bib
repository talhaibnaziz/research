ABSTRACT="In a device to device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular network,
total system sum rate can be improved if cellular user equipments (UEs) and
D2D pairs share resource blocks. We consider such an optimization problem
where the objective is to maximize the total sum rate of the system while
sharing resource blocks (RBs) between cellular UEs and D2D pairs and
maintaining some quality of service (QoS) requirements. Most of the
existing algorithms consider that sharing can only improve the sum rate.
However, a particular sharing can also decrease the sum rate. Considering
this observation, we design an optimal algorithm based on weighted
bipartite matching which avoids such sharing and maximize the total system
sum rate. We prove that our algorithm is optimal and validate the results
through simulations which shows that our algorithm outperforms other
existing heuristics in terms of maximizing system sum rate. Our algorithm
also performs better in terms of total interference introduced through the
sharing of resource blocks between cellular equipments and D2D pairs."

ABSTRACT="Interference minimization while maintaining a target system sum rate by
sharing resource among cellular User Equipments (UEs) and Device-to-Device
pairs (D2D) is an important research question in Long Term Evolution (LTE).
We propose a two phase resource allocation algorithm for this research
problem. In the first phase, we use the bipartite matching algorithm to
minimize the interference which also avoids matching that can decrease the
total system sum rate. In some cases, after the first phase, the solution
may not be the optimal one. Therefore, in the second phase, we use a local
search algorithm to improve the solution. We compare our algorithm with two
other existing algorithms (MIKIRA and TAFIRA) which address the same
research problem. We prove that MIKIRA fails to provide feasible solutions
in most of the cases. We also show that the performance ratio of TAFIRA can
be unbounded in the worst case. Moreover, in some cases, TAFIRA can not
provide any solution of the problem where solutions exist. We prove that,
our algorithm always provides the solution whenever it exists. We perform
extensive simulations of the algorithms and find that in all cases, our
solution is either optimal or very close to the optimal."
