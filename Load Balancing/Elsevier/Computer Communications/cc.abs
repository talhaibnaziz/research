			Software Defined-Networks (SDNs) decouple the traditional protocol stack into the control plane and the data plane consisting of - controllers and switches, respectively. The controllers are placed in the network considering numerous fundamental parameters like flow-setup latency, switch-controller control traffic, route synchronization latency, reliability, and security. While many researchers address the resultant Controller Placement Problem (CPP), very few provide a thorough and efficient process that considers multiple core parameters. In this paper, we propose three algorithms to cluster the network, place controllers, and assign switches dynamically to controllers in polynomial time. Extensive simulations on two hundred and forty-three (243) existing network topologies suggest that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art controller placement algorithms in terms of flow-setup latency and traffic-awareness.
